# Classroom Seat Allocation System

## Overview
This project develops a system that analyzes an image of a classroom, identifies empty seats, and allocates incoming students to those seats in a way that clusters them together. The goal is to group students in one area of the classroom, making it easier for the teacher to focus on a single section.

## Directory Structure
- `data/images/`: Contains input classroom images.
- `data/output/`: Stores output Excel files with seat status.
- `src/`: Contains the main script and dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/classroom-seat-allocation.git
   cd classroom-seat-allocation
